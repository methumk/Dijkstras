**GUI**
- Adding/Deleting Nodes
- Linking Nodes (user has to add weights, automatic, editable?)
- clearing everything (nodes and links)
- Toggling Dijkstra table
- Toggling Dijkstra drawing

**Intrinsic**
- Dijkstra algorithm (will it work on one node?)
    - Dijkstra would need to know structure of drawn nodes

- Implementation (Gui -> Dijkstra -> Node structure)
- Gui is going to control both the node structure and the toggling the Dijkstra algorithm on and off
